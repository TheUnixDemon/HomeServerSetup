# Setup - MyHomePi

Here I explain how I setup my own server for my private usage at home. I use the RaspberryPi 4b with 8GB memory and a external hard driver as a storage.  
Also [here](./Resources/SERVICES.md) a list of services that I host right now. These services, it's usage and it's installation will be expained later on.
